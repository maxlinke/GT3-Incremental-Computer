also core and task upgrades
might be a neat idea to have the final upgrades of the final components be ridiculously expensive but also only take up 1 slot
maybe a game-over (failure) detection (running but no income, not enough money (including sales) for buying a basic sched and proc)
maybe a win-detection (overflow)
i'll have to tweak my stuff. progression is too fast but also ends too early at the moment
do the give-resources-on-save-load thing as a "daily login" bonus (ugh...)... like +10% of all currency + component prices together..
