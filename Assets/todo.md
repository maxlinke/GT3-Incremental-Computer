move command

upgrades
    the abstract base classes are already there, just gotta use them

savedata
    do the auto-save on quit again, with the prompt on reopen and a little gain for the time spent closed (if running)

temperature
    the whole impulse thing. basically just a lerp i guess. if the temp is 21 and the impulse has 100 as the target and a lerp of 0.1, it's going to add a bigger number than if the temp is already 90 and the impulse is identical.
