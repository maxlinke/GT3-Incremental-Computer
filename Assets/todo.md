also core and task upgrades
might be a neat idea to have the final upgrades of the final components be ridiculously expensive but also only take up 1 slot
maybe a game-over (failure) detection (running but no income, not enough money (including sales) for buying a basic sched and proc)
maybe a win-detection (overflow)
// i'll have to tweak my stuff. progression is too fast but also ends too early at the moment
more tweaking, but this time make the higher end things either give way more money or be way cheaper. progression kinda stalls fairly early...
