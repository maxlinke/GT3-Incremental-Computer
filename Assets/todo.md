move command
couple more graphics for the component views
maybe a few more upgrades
and possible more tiers
also core and task upgrades
might be a neat idea to have the final upgrades of the final components be ridiculously expensive but also only take up 1 slot
maybe a game-over (failure) detection (running but no income, not enough money (including sales) for buying a basic sched and proc)
maybe a win-detection (overflow)
i'll have to tweak my stuff. progression is too fast but also ends too early at the moment
